# Problem Statement

## 1. What are we trying to build
In an ideal online world, social interaction would be easy and flexible, like in real life. There should be a perfect platform for online social interaction, along with **Humanity caring empowered by AI**. The platform would combine different ways of communication, and by using the platform, users could easily enjoy the excitement of meeting new people, having discussions, and building private & long-lasting connections. You can have a good start even if you are not good at socializing.

This platform would not only connect people but also help them form bonds. Besides these, it would offer **AI guidance** to help users improve their profiles, suggest ways to start conversations, and even practice conversations by acting as their chat partners. In this platform, no user feels lonely, as AI companions would be available to chat with those who have not found a chat partner yet.

## 2. Current Situation
Today's social platforms are a landscape of missed opportunities, failing to provide the integrated and supportive experience users crave. Most importantly, they lack **Humanity caring**. The user journey is fragmented across multiple apps, each with critical gaps that FlirtNet is designed to fill.

### 2.1 Passive and Unsupportive Platforms
Current apps are not designed for those who may struggle with socializing. They are passive venues that offer no tools to help a user start a good chat or build confidence. This lack of AI-driven guidance can also make the experience feel isolating, especially when a valued connection is lost.

### 2.2 Ephemeral Encounters, No Follow-Through
Random chat apps (like OmeTV) offer the thrill of discovery but lack a **Connection System**. A promising conversation is lost forever with a single click, leaving no path to build a lasting relationship.

### 2.3 Public Forums, No Personal Bridge
Community platforms (like Reddit or TieBa) are great for public discussion but fail to transition these interactions into private connections. They lack an integrated and seamless path from a shared interest in the **Public Square** to a one-on-one **Private Messaging** experience.

The results of these problems are serious:

1. The mental effort of managing accounts and apps for different social needs makes users tired of these platforms. Users are unsatisfied, as no single platform gives them the complete social experience they want.
2. They lead to a trend of shallow chats and social anxiety. Being unable to link an encounter means that many potential connections will be missed. Because of the lack of guidance (like AI’s suggestions), users often struggle alone to think of meaningful topics or edit their profile to make themselves more attractive. The fear of "saying the wrong thing" prevents many connections from ever starting.
3. Most dangerously, they create an unsafe and unfriendly online space. Bad behavior easily happens if the platform fails to use platform-wide safety checks and user verification. Not only does it put users in danger, but it also damages public trust in the platform, making people unwilling to join in.

## 3. The Proposal: FlirtNet, An AI Integrated Social Platform
We propose the development of a complete social platform -- **"FlirtNet"**, which is designed to fix the problems above by integrating core social functions with advanced AI services. It directly addresses the fragmentation, safety issues, and the deep-seated user anxieties identified in the consequences.

### 3.1 Core Social Features
1. **The Discovery**: A text-only random matching service. This part acts as the "discovery" path, letting users have playful and engaging one-on-one chats. Importantly, it will be supported by our login system to stop fake accounts.
2. **The Connection System**: This part serves as the bridge from temporary to permanent. Users who have a good chat in the Discovery can send a **“Connection” (friend) request**. Once accepted, they are added to a **“Connections List”** that both users agree to.
3. **The Public Square**: A public forum where users can create profiles, publish posts (text, images), follow topics, and join in discussions.
4. **Private Messaging**: A one-on-one messaging system available only between users who are **"Connections"**. This provides a safe and private space for developing the connections discovered on the platform.

### 3.2 AI Features
To enhance the user’s experience, we will also provide **AI-powered services**:

1. **AI Companion**: If a user cannot find a match for a long time, the AI can pretend to be a user and chat with them. This ensures continuous engagement.
2. **AI Legacy Partner**: For users who form a long-term connection but eventually lose contact, the AI can be trained on the partner's chat history and asked to imitate their tone, offering emotional continuity.
3. **Intelligent Matching Assistant**: AI can analyze user interests and communication styles to improve the quality and success rate of new matches.
4. **AI Wingman**: Based on the connections' profile, the AI can provide real-time advice on how to start the chat, suggesting specific topics or opening sentences.
5. **Atmosphere Analyzer**: The AI can analyze the conversation to help the user understand the current atmosphere.
6. **AI Profile Optimizer**: AI can give feedback and suggestions on how to optimize their profile.
7. **AI Practice Mode**: Users can practice full simulated conversations with the AI before engaging with a real person, building confidence in a risk-free environment.

This single system addresses the problems directly. It will remove the need for downloading many applications. It will build a path from random meetings to lasting connections for users. It will integrate a suite of AI tools designed to foster deeper, safer, and more long-lasting connections. Finally, it addresses safety concerns by basing the entire platform on necessary user registration and comprehensive content checks.
