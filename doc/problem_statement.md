# Problem Statement

## 1. Background
Today many online dating platforms and social apps feel cold and not very caring. People use different apps for random chat, for public posts, and for private messaging. Switching between them is tiring, and it is easy to lose good connections.

Some users also feel shy or anxious when talking to new people. They do not always know how to start a conversation or how to keep it going. When a good chat suddenly ends, there is often no simple way to continue the relationship.

## 2. Current Situation
Today's online dating platforms and social apps are a landscape of missed opportunities, failing to provide the integrated and supportive experience users crave. Most importantly, they lack humanity caring. The user journey is fragmented across multiple apps, each with critical gaps that our project is designed to fill.

### 2.1 Passive and Unsupportive Platforms
Current apps are not designed for those who may struggle with socializing. They are passive venues that offer no tools to help a user start a good chat or build confidence. This lack of AI-driven guidance can also make the experience feel isolating, especially when a valued connection is lost.

### 2.2 Ephemeral Encounters, No Follow-Through
Random chat apps (like OmeTV) offer the thrill of discovery but lack a simple connection system. A promising conversation can be lost forever with a single click, leaving no easy path to build a lasting relationship.

### 2.3 Public Forums, No Personal Bridge
Community platforms (like Reddit or TieBa) are great for public discussion but do not make it easy to move from a public post to a private, deeper chat. They lack an integrated and seamless path from the Public Square to Private Messaging.

### 2.4 Traditional Tech Unable to Detect Abusing/Harmful/Aggressive Info Efficiently
Most existing dating platforms still depend on simple keyword filters and manual user reports to catch abusive, harassing, or aggressive messages. These approaches miss subtle forms of harm (passive‑aggressive tone, coercive pressure, grooming attempts, emotional manipulation) because they rely on surface words, not context. Manual review is also slow: harmful content can remain visible long enough to cause emotional damage or drive a user away. As a result, users often have to personally endure or document the problem before anything happens, which increases frustration and reduces trust in the platform.

## 3. Why These Problem Matters

Because of the issues listed above, many users do not get the deep and caring social experience they want. They may feel lonely even when they are online, and they may be afraid to talk to new people. At the same time, unsafe behavior can make the environment even worse.

We think there is a need for a platform that reduces these problems by:
- Making it easier to move from a random chat to a long‑term connection.
- Giving users some guidance and support when they are shy or unsure, provide them some help when they are down.
- Paying more attention to safety and trust.
