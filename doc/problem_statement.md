# Problem Statement

## 1. Background
Today many online social platforms feel cold and not very caring. People use different apps for random chat, for public posts, and for private messaging. Switching between them is tiring, and it is easy to lose good connections.

Some users also feel shy or anxious when talking to new people. They do not always know how to start a conversation or how to keep it going. When a good chat suddenly ends, there is often no simple way to continue the relationship.

## 2. Current Situation
Today's social platforms are a landscape of missed opportunities, failing to provide the integrated and supportive experience users crave. Most importantly, they lack **humanity caring**. The user journey is fragmented across multiple apps, each with critical gaps that our project is designed to fill.

### 2.1 Passive and Unsupportive Platforms
Current apps are not designed for those who may struggle with socializing. They are passive venues that offer no tools to help a user start a good chat or build confidence. This lack of AI-driven guidance can also make the experience feel isolating, especially when a valued connection is lost.

### 2.2 Ephemeral Encounters, No Follow-Through
Random chat apps (like OmeTV) offer the thrill of discovery but lack a simple **connection system**. A promising conversation can be lost forever with a single click, leaving no easy path to build a lasting relationship.

### 2.3 Public Forums, No Personal Bridge
Community platforms (like Reddit or TieBa) are great for public discussion but do not make it easy to move from a public post to a private, deeper chat. They lack an integrated and seamless path from the **Public Square** to **Private Messaging**.

The results of these problems are serious:

1. The mental effort of managing accounts and apps for different social needs makes users tired of these platforms. Users are unsatisfied, as no single platform gives them the complete social experience they want.
2. They lead to a trend of shallow chats and social anxiety. Being unable to link an encounter means that many potential connections will be missed. Because of the lack of guidance (like AI’s suggestions), users often struggle alone to think of meaningful topics or edit their profile to make themselves more attractive. The fear of "saying the wrong thing" prevents many connections from ever starting.
3. Most dangerously, they create an unsafe and unfriendly online space. Bad behavior easily happens if the platform does not use platform‑wide safety checks and user verification. Not only does it put users in danger, but it also damages public trust in the platform, making people unwilling to join.

## 3. Why This Problem Matters

Because of the issues above, many users do not get the deep and caring social experience they want. They may feel lonely even when they are online, and they may be afraid to talk to new people. At the same time, unsafe behavior can make the environment even worse.

We think there is a need for a platform that reduces these problems by:
- Making it easier to move from a random chat to a long‑term connection.
- Giving users some guidance and support when they are shy or unsure.
- Paying more attention to safety and trust.
