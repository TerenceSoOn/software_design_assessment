# Project Proposal – FlirtNet

## 1. Idea of the Project
We want to build **FlirtNet**, an online social platform that is more caring and friendly than many apps today. Our goal is to help people meet new friends, keep good connections, and feel less lonely. We also want to use AI to give users some guidance and support.

On FlirtNet, users should be able to:
- Discover new people and start one‑to‑one chats.
- Turn a good chat into a long‑term connection.
- Join public discussions and share posts.
- Get help from AI when they feel shy or don’t know how to start a conversation.

## 2. Why We Chose This Idea
From our experience and observation, many current social apps feel cold and not very supportive. If you are not good at socializing, it is easy to feel lost. Also, many random chat apps do not help you keep a good connection, and public forums do not give an easy path to private, deeper chats. We think there is space for a platform that cares more about the user’s feelings and gives some AI help.

## 3. Main Features 

### 3.1 Core Social Features
1. **The Discovery**  
   A text‑only random matching service. Users can be matched with others and have playful one‑on‑one chats. The matching will be connected with the login system to reduce fake accounts.

2. **The Connection System**  
   After a good chat in the Discovery, users can send a **connection request** (similar to a friend request). Once accepted, both users will appear in each other’s **Connections List**.

3. **The Public Square**  
   A public area where users can create profiles, publish posts (text and images), follow topics, and join discussions.

4. **Private Messaging**  
   A one‑on‑one messaging system that works only between users who are connections. This gives a more private and safer space for deeper conversations.

### 3.2 AI‑Supported Features
To improve the user experience, we also plan to add several AI‑powered services:

1. **AI Companion**  
   If a user cannot find a match for a long time, the AI can pretend to be a user and chat with them, so they are not left alone.

2. **AI Legacy Partner**  
   If a user had a long‑term connection and later loses contact, they can choose to let the AI imitate that partner’s tone based on chat history (if allowed). This may offer some emotional support.

3. **Intelligent Matching Assistant**  
   AI can analyze users’ interests and communication styles to help improve the quality of matches.

4. **AI Wingman**  
   Based on the other person’s profile, the AI can suggest ways to start a chat, including sample topics or opening sentences.

5. **Atmosphere Analyzer**  
   The AI can analyze the conversation and give feedback about the current atmosphere (for example, relaxed, awkward, serious).

6. **AI Profile Optimizer**  
   AI can give suggestions on how to improve the user’s profile to make it more attractive and clear.

7. **AI Practice Mode**  
   Users can practice full simulated conversations with the AI before chatting with a real person, so they can build confidence in a low‑risk environment.

## 4. Expected Benefits

The platform would reduce the need to downloading many different apps for different social goals. It would also provide a clear path from random meetings to long‑term connections. With the AI tools, users who are shy or nervous could start and maintain conversations more easily. Finally, safety and trust would be improved  through login and content checks (to be detailed more in the requirements).
