Now lets welcome Rico To tell you more about FlirtNet

"Thanks to Wangyueshen. Now that we have our profile set up and we've explored the community, let's dive into the core interactive experiences of FlirtNet—where the real magic happens."

"We know that jumping straight into dating can be scary, especially for those who are shy. That's why we built the Practice Mode.
Here you can practice your skills on flirting before you actually talk to a real person."


"Once you're ready, it's time to actually meet someone new. Our Random Matching system connects you instantly with other users online, based on your gender and preference"


"After you match someone,  you can start your conversation freely. You can see his avatar, age, bio and interests on the top, which help you get to know about a stranger quickly. But we all know the hardest part of chatting with a stranger is keeping the conversation going..."


"This is where FlirtNet truly shines. Meet the Wingman.
If you ever get stuck or don't know what to say, just click the 'Help' button. The Wingman analyzes the current 'vibe' of the conversation and suggests the perfect, flirty response to keep things flowing. It’s like having a dating coach sitting right next to you."

"Meeting strangers requires safety, we prioritize your mental well-being above all else. If a conversation turns toxic, you should report it without hesitation. Our system will response to your report instantly with a feedback. If the reported user is judged guilty, his account will be banned immediately. For example, he is not loving me enough"


"The feedback for your result comes our very quick,  Of course, that wasn’t a good reason, so our system deny your report.


"If the chat ends up well, you don't want to lose that person, you should definitely send a Request to him. This is how you turn a random encounter into a long-lasting relation. Maybe he would be the right one"


"Here you can see all your Datemates, and the pending request. Accepting it makes that person your official Datemates."


"Once you are Datemates, you unlock Private Chat. This is a secure space for you two. And don't worry—the Wingman is still available here too, helping you deepen the relationship as you get to know each other better."


"So, what if you chat with someone and your relationship ends up badly, that’s it, you broke up, and you miss that person so much that you cannot sleep at night. 
Miss Ex is here to help. It can simulate your love one’s  tone based on your chat history. It provides a space for closure, helping users process their emotions and eventually move on."


"So, from practicing your first 'Hello' to managing deep relationships and even finding closure, FlirtNet will be together with you on every stage of your emotional journey.

Now, to introduce our architecture and design, let's welcome Aris

Hi everyone. Let me walk you through the Architecture and Design of FlirtNet.

First, let's look at our Design Pattern. We use the classic MVC structure to keep things organized:

- Model : This is our database layer where we store user data.

- View : This is the React frontend, which handles what users actually see.

- Controller : This is our FastAPI backend, which handles the business logic.

  This separation makes our code clean and easy to maintain.


Next, for our Tech Stack :

- On the Frontend , we use React . It's fast and responsive.
- On the Backend , we chose FastAPI . As the name says, it's very fast and great for modern web apps.
- For the Database , we are currently using SQLite for simplicity.
- And most importantly, for the chat features, we use Socket.IO to enable real-time messaging.3. UI Design 

Finally, about our UI Design .
We wanted FlirtNet to feel modern and romantic.
So we used a style called Liquid Glass or Glassmorphism.
You can see translucent cards and blur effects throughout the app.
We also used Pink and Purple gradients as our main colors to create a warm, dating-friendly atmosphere.

That's all for the design and architecture, next part, we will talk about future work, welcome my next partner to present it

Looking ahead, we have a clear roadmap to make FlirtNet more powerful, sustainable, and professional.

First, we will roll out essential feature updates.
Users will be able to share images in both random and private chats, making conversations richer. We’ll add more control over relationships, allowing you to remove a datemate or add someone to a blacklist. To make connections even deeper, we will introduce voice and video chat. And for your account security, we’ll implement standard features like password changes and secure email-based password resets.

Second, to ensure FlirtNet’s long-term growth, we will introduce a Pro subscription.
This will sustainably separate free users from Pro users. Free access will remain generous, but Pro users will enjoy unlimited key features: unlimited random chats to meet more people, unlimited uses of the AI Wingman for constant conversation coaching, unlimited profile optimizations, and exclusive access to the sensitive Miss Ex feature for emotional continuity.

Finally, we are committed to making FlirtNet a more robust and professional platform.
Technically, we will upgrade our database from SQLite to PostgreSQL for better performance, scalability, and reliability as we grow. We will greatly improve compatibility, ensuring a seamless experience not just on web but also natively on Windows and mobile devices. Furthermore, we will enable public IP access, which is a crucial step for broader deployment and future integrations.

This three-pillar plan—enhancing features, building a sustainable model, and strengthening our foundation—is how we will evolve FlirtNet into the leading, caring social platform. Thank you.

Now lets take a look on the demo of flirt net.
